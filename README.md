GitHub for Known
================

Adds support for publishing GitHub issues and comments to the 
[Known CMS](http://withknown.com). 

To create an issue, make the "target URL" the link to the GitHub project you
want to open an issue on. To create a comment on an existing issue, make the
"target URL" the link to the issue you want to comment on.

The actual publishing to GitHub is outside of the scope of this plugin, and if
you want the issues to automatically publish, 
[use Bridgy](https://brid.gy/about#github-issue-comment). The plugin will send
webmentions to Bridgy automatically.
